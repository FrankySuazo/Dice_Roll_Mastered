# Dice_Roll_Mastered
In one of my previous projects, I called "Dice-Roll", is a simple concept of like dice roll, but with only numbers. I decided to make similar one that simultaneously could throw more dices with their actual image of the number that's being randomize, just like an actual dice. I brought my idea to life with this project and consistently changed the code to make it even more simple with the same concept!

Care to give it a try?
